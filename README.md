# StockMarketApp

The app uses dependency injection with Daeger-Hil, SOLID principles, CSV parsing with OpenCSV, working with remote APIs using Retrofing, local caching with Room and custom drawing on a canvas using Jetpack Compose. 

It also follows architectural guidelines.

App gets data from an api, puts it into local database (caching) and then uses that data.
